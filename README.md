# Sales Analysis

## Project Overview:

### Introduction:
This project focuses on data analysis using Python's Pandas library. Pandas is a powerful and flexible open-source data manipulation and analysis tool, widely used in the data science and analytics community. This project serves as a template for performing data analysis tasks, and it can be a starting point for various data exploration and manipulation projects.

## Key Highlights:

##### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Cleaning and preparing data is important for analyzing it. We use Pandas to do this effectively by fixing mistakes, handling missing data, transforming data and organizing variables for analysis.

##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a key step in understanding and analyzing data. It involves examining and visualizing the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. In our project, we use EDA to gain a deeper understanding of the data and inform subsequent analysis.

##### Data Merging and Joining
We have combined 2 CSV files: List of Orders and Order Details wo achieve a larger data set to work with and more mensurable data.

##### Data Visualization
I have prepared variuous visual formats like charts or graphs to make it easier to understand. It helps reveal patterns and trends in the data, making complex information more accessible and aiding in better decision-making.

The project includes a well-documented Jupyter notebook, providing a step-by-step walkthrough of the data analysis process. Additionally, I have prepared a concise report summarizing key findings and insights derived from the analysis.
